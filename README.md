- **Item Browsing and Filtering** — Browse the public catalog and filter by category, campus location, or keyword search.
- **Request and Approval Workflow** — Requesters submit requests on items; donors approve or reject them from their dashboard.

- **Real-Time Notifications** — Users receive instant notifications for new requests, approvals, rejections, and new messages.
